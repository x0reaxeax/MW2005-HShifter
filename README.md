# Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005) H-Shifter Support

This mod adds emulation for H-Shifter behavior in Need for Speed: Most Wanted 2005.

## Usage
1. Download and place the [MW2005-HShifter.asi](https://github.com/x0reaxeax/MW2005-HShifter/releases) file either in the game folder or the `scripts` folder in the main game directory.
2. Start the game, and press the number keys (0â€“7) to shift into the corresponding gear. (NOT Num-Pad keys)! There is no UI for the mod.

## Notes
Optionally, you can inject the mod file as a DLL into the game process at any time.

Make sure you're using the top row number keys 0-7 (**NOT NumPad!**) to switch to a respective gear.

This "mod" can be utilized with hardware H-Shifters, such as Logitech Driving Force Shifter, by mapping the shifter's gears to respective keys (0-7).

**Only 1.3 Black Edition is supported.**
