# Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005) H-Shifter Support

This mod adds emulation for H-Shifter behavior in Need for Speed: Most Wanted 2005.

Number keys 0-7 (**NOT NumPad!**) are used to switch to a respective gear.

This can be utilized with hardware H-Shifters, such as Logitech Driving Force Shifter, by mapping the shifter's gears to respective keys (0-7).

**Only 1.3 Black Edition is supported.**
